        We will need some information about your device. To retrieve, please:

        - Make sure you have the latest version of the Tuya Homey App installed
        - Open https://my.homey.app using a laptop/desktop
        - Add your device if you didn't already
        - Open its settings and copy the specifications from the "Device Specification" setting
        - Paste the value below

        The device specification will look like `{ "device": ..., "specifications": ..., 'data_points': ...}`. If it shows `<not available>` you can either re-add your device, or add it as other/unknown to retrieve the correct value.

        When this information is missing or incorrect, we will need to close your request!
